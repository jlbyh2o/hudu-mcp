# HUDU MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with HUDU for technical documentation and customer information management. This server allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with HUDU's API to retrieve customer account information, knowledge base articles, assets, and more.

## Features

- **Company/Customer Management**: Retrieve company information and details
- **Knowledge Base Access**: Search and retrieve technical documentation articles
- **Asset Management**: Access asset information and password management
- **Secure Authentication**: API key-based authentication with HUDU
- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript and Zod validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- A HUDU instance with API access
- HUDU API key (obtainable from your HUDU admin panel)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hudu-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create environment configuration:
```bash
cp src/.env.example .env
```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your HUDU credentials:
```env
HUDU_API_KEY=your_hudu_api_key_here
HUDU_BASE_URL=https://your-hudu-instance.huducloud.com
```

5. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Running the Server

**Development mode:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production mode:**
```bash
npm start
```

### Available Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools for LLM interaction:

#### Company/Customer Tools

**`get_companies`** - Retrieve a list of companies/customers

  - `name` (optional): Filter companies by name
  - `page` (optional): Page number for pagination
  - `page_size` (optional): Number of results per page

**`get_company_details`** - Get detailed information about a specific company
- Parameters:
  - `id` (required): Company ID

#### Knowledge Base Tools

**`search_articles`** - Search knowledge base articles
- Parameters:
  - `search` (optional): Search query for articles
  - `company_id` (optional): Filter articles by company ID
  - `page` (optional): Page number for pagination
  - `page_size` (optional): Number of results per page

**`get_article`** - Get detailed content of a specific article
- Parameters:
  - `id` (required): Article ID

#### Asset Management Tools

**`get_assets`** - Retrieve assets for a company
- Parameters:
  - `company_id` (optional): Company ID to filter assets
  - `asset_layout_id` (optional): Filter by asset layout ID
  - `page` (optional): Page number for pagination
  - `page_size` (optional): Number of results per page

**`get_asset_passwords`** - Retrieve password assets (credentials) for a company

  - `company_id` (optional): Company ID to filter passwords
  - `name` (optional): Filter by password name
  - `page` (optional): Page number for pagination

*Note: Passwords are masked in list responses for security. Individual password retrieval would require additional implementation.*

### Example Usage with Claude Desktop

1. Add the server to your Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hudu": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/hudu-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "HUDU_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "HUDU_BASE_URL": "https://your-hudu-instance.huducloud.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Restart Claude Desktop

3. You can now ask Claude to:
   - "Show me all companies in HUDU"
   - "Find articles about network configuration for company ID 123"
   - "Get details for company 'Acme Corp'"
   - "List all assets for company ID 456"

## API Integration

This MCP server integrates with the HUDU API v1. The following endpoints are supported:

- `/api/v1/companies` - Company management
- `/api/v1/articles` - Knowledge base articles
- `/api/v1/assets` - Asset management
- `/api/v1/asset_passwords` - Password/credential management
- `/api/v1/asset_layouts` - Asset layout definitions
- `/api/v1/activity_logs` - Activity logging
- `/api/v1/api_info` - API information

## Development

### Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts              # Main MCP server entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ hudu-client.ts        # HUDU API client with type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts          # Tool registration and routing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ company-tools.ts  # Company/customer related tools
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ article-tools.ts  # Knowledge base article tools
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ asset-tools.ts    # Asset management tools
â””â”€â”€ .env.example          # Environment configuration template
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build the TypeScript project
- `npm run dev` - Run in development mode with hot reload
- `npm run start` - Run the built server
- `npm run watch` - Watch for changes and rebuild
- `npm run clean` - Clean the dist directory

### Adding New Tools

1. Define the tool schema and handler in the appropriate tools file
2. Add the tool name to the routing logic in `tools/index.ts`
3. Update the tool list in `index.ts`
4. Add corresponding API methods to `hudu-client.ts` if needed

## Security Considerations

- API keys are passed via environment variables
- Passwords are masked in list responses
- All API requests include proper authentication headers
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Comprehensive error handling to prevent information leakage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Configuration validation failed"**
- Ensure `HUDU_API_KEY` and `HUDU_BASE_URL` are set in your environment
- Verify the API key is valid and has appropriate permissions

**"HUDU API Error (401)"**
- Check that your API key is correct
- Verify the API key has not expired
- Ensure your HUDU user has API access permissions

**"HUDU API Error (404)"**
- Verify the HUDU_BASE_URL is correct
- Check that the HUDU instance is accessible

**Connection timeouts**
- Check network connectivity to your HUDU instance
- Verify firewall settings allow outbound HTTPS connections

### Debugging

Enable debug logging by setting the environment variable:
```bash
DEBUG=hudu-mcp:*
```
